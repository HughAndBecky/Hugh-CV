This project includes combining and collating several U̠t-Ma'in databases that Becky Paterson has created over the 12 years she has worked with the U̠t-Ma'in language community. We are also importing as many Hausa terms as possible for specific elicitation (such as regional plants and animals). The final database includes grammatical features of individual lexemes. We are including various external analyses from phonology tools. None of this data is currently public. But when it is, a link from here will be posted.

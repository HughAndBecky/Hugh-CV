This project was a colaboration with [Steve Moitiozo](https://twitter.com/stevemoitozo2?lang=en). He generally has the conversations, and therefore provided the content fodder. I facilitated graphical design of these ideas. I provided the cavas layout and graphic design.

The project resulted in two tools. A canvas which helps a business "owner" or and entrepreneur discover where their bussiness is currently and what sorts of actions they should be looking at to determin how their business fits into the market.

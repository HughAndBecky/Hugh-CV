Becky receive a grant to help collect her dissertation data. The terms of the grant require her to record and archive oral histories of U̠t-Ma'in. My role in this project is to take the recordings and work with native speakers to transcribe them and turn them into story books.

Currently there are three books in U̠t-Ma'in. Two of them are reading primers.

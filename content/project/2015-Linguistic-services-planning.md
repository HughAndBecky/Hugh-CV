This work was housed under SIL International's Language Program Training (ILPT) department. I was able to help facilitate service design conversations both inside and outside the department. We used the business model canvas to capture business activities. We were then able to use the [Value Proposition Canvas](https://www.expressiveproductdesign.com/value-proposition-canvas/) to talk about how we might add value to our customers by addressing their pain points. We wanted to know what a more valued service might look like to our customers.

We also introduced a service maturity model to help business plan owners look at the maturity of their business model and service and pursue growth opportunities.

Often in business modeling final solutions _pencil out_ in financial numbers. With NGO work we have multiple non-traditional applications of the Business Model Canvas. For instance:

+ We have customers who are not the payees.
+ We have social impact goals compete with financial goals.
+ We have income streams which are not directly tied to output services rendered or products produced.

This project started out with a personal interest in the variation of copyright laws from a global perspective. But some simple investagation has shown that there is a lot more related to law and legal policy and the vitality of language, and the availability of linguistic or language based resources. Several collaborations and discussions have bennefitted from this research. Ultimatly the results of this research should be in a browsable database, not in some sort of publication.

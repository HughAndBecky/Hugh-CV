abstract = "Language archives effectively achieve their stated goal of long-term data storage, but they often fail to meet the needs of both community member users and also researcher users. We present the mismatch between the services offered by ‘language archives’ and the jobs to be done by both segments of archive service consumers as a business model mismatch. We present this mismatch as a business risk which mitigates against the mission of archives. Finally, we discuss some technical innovations which would bring workflow revisions and ease consumer friction, but we hold that this is ultimately a business model problem and not a technological problem, because an organization’s business plan is what drives it choice of technological deployment."

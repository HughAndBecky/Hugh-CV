**Abstract**

We argue that a visual modality is needed to account for phonetic contrasts and is important to the accurate interpretation of the historical development of language change including phonetic contrasts and phonemic oppositions. Previous studies situate the stability of phonetic contrasts and phonemic oppositions along two co-existing frameworks:
Speakers vary their speech to create a notion of solidarity. This is interpreted to either reinforce a notion of identity or a variation from an established identity in pursuit of identifying with some sociological notion of prestige (Weirich & Simpson 2017).
Speech-Interlocutors engage in a communicative event which consists of oral and aural factors. This has often been categorized as speech production and speech perception (Kleber et al. 2012). This dichotomy has also been foundational in framing historical linguistic debates over the the most probable reconstruction in West Germanic between \[θ, f\] (Jones 2002).
We agree with the first framework and that there is ample evidence to suggest that speakers can hold multiple identities, such as in diglossic and multilingual situations. We also hold that what one holds as prestige can and often does change through time. Intra- and inter-speaker variability does change as life events impact perceptions of identity and opinions about prestige.
However, we feel the second experimental framework, situating the analysis within a dichotomy of oral production and aural perception, is to narrow to fully address the factors influencing the stability of phonetic contrasts and phonemic oppositions.  A visual modality account is needed because the human communication system uses visual cues to disambiguate other communicative modalities.
We appeal to three classes of data: first, we raise the issue of phonological and phonetic change in sign languages; second, we appeal to the plethora of evidence on the integration of audio and visual cues in the communication stream from well studied languages; third we appeal to accounts of what might be considered typological rarities. However, we contend that these “rarities” may not be as rare as the current literature would lead us to believe – in part due to the typical phonetic analysis which only looks at the oral-aural connection, and not the whole communicative system.
American Sign Language communities have undergone a shift since the 1990s from using a “Y” hand shape (Signing Savvy [a] 2018) with the sign for PHONE to using a “C” hand shape (Signing Savvy [b] 2018). Several factors can be pointed to as motivation of change, but the point remains that the articulatory change is only visually perceivable.
The integration of visual cues in the speech stream is well studied in Indo-European languages. McGurk & MacDonald (1976) show that American English speakers often misperceive stops when audio and visual cues are not aligned. Traunmüller & Öhrström (2007) show that Swedish vowels have associated visual cues. Johnson et al. (2007) suggest that the salient perceptual cue for [ŋ] in the Toulouse variety of French is visual rather than aural. Studies of the “McGurk Effect” show that listener’s perception can be destabilized by altering visual cues, indicating a high degree of reliance on the visual cue.
Several languages have phonetic articulations in which active articulators become visible in an extra-labial manner. Olson et al. (2010) describe nine Philippine languages and five Australian languages as having an interdental approximant [ð̞]; Harley (2012) describes another three in Africa, while Everett (1982) describes one from South America. The case of the Philippine languages are relevant in a historical linguistic perspective for two reasons: first, the prestige language has shifted to a cognate [l] articulation, and Gallman (1997) notes that speakers of Mandayan (ethnolinguistic minority) will replace the articulation with [l] in the company of ethnic-majority language speakers, opting to associate with the prestige culture, rather than their ethnic identity. Everett notes that only social insiders are permitted to see the extra-labial articulation; when outsiders are present, a [g] is produced. The second, is that the interdental approximant shows up as a reflex of proto-Austronesian (PAn) \*R. Olson et al. present the Philippine languages as being along the periphery of the Philippine archipelago; peripheries are commonly known for being less innovative than the center of a network. Along with comparative evidence this leads to a strong argument that the Philippine [ð̞] is not an innovation, but rather a retention. Languages in the center of the Philippine archipelago have reflexes of PAn \*R which include: /l/, /Ø/, /b/, /w/, /ɻ/, /ʔ/, /ɣ/ and an unspecified velar segment. All of these inner-region reflexes conform to ethnic majority societal norms, which hide the tongue from an interlocutor.
This evidence argues for a framework encompassing the oral, aural, and visual modalities that influence the stability of phonetic contrasts and phonemic oppositions. Such a framework could then handle all language, spoken and signed, and provide insight to situations where the visual modality plays a part that either disamiguates or motivates phonetic instabilities.

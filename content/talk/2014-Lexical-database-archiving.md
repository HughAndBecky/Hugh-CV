abstract = "Archives  and  language  artifacts  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in  linguistics, folklore  studies,  ethnic  studies,  language  documentation,  ethnomusicology,  (minority language  focused)  multi-lingual  education,  and  anthropology.  Funding  agencies  like the  NSF,    NEH,  DEL,  CIRC,  SOAS/ELDP,  DoBeS,  and  private  foundations  require grantees  to  archive  their   content.   However,  as  producers  of  language  material artifacts, do archiving requirements come to us begrudgingly  or  do we embrace them? Building on  previously  presented work  (Paterson & Nordmoe 2013) about the practice of Archiving  at  the SIL Language and Culture Archive,  Hugh  presents an  overview  of linguistic  archiving and a  discussion  of  his recent  survey on  the practice of  archiving lexical  databases.  This  is  the  first  known  global  survey  that attempts  to  assess  the archiving habits of linguists across disciplines and institutional affiliations."

Hugh J. Paterson III (2014) *Language archiving and data ecology*. Presentation at the University of Oregon GLOSS and the Department of Linguistics Colloquium, Eugene, OR, 23 May.

This presentation is part of a series of presentations based on analyzing user interactions with the SIL Language and Culture Archive. This presentation is mostly the same content as what was later presented in a poster at the 4th International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation.

Hugh J. Paterson III, John Clifton & Steve A. Marlett (2009) Lasting Linguistics: Making a Meaningful Mark. University of North Dakota 2009 linguistics colloquium series, 30 July.

**Summary**

This was three mini-presentations covering different perspectives on language documentation. Materials from the presentation include two slide decks and two handouts. My main presentation point is that we should be considering Search dynamics and Search Engine Optimization for language documentation materials.
